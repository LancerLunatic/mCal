  <p> require('bootstrap') will load all of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The bootstrap module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap's jQuery plugins individually by loading the /js/*.js files under the package's top-level directory.<br /><br />
Bootstrap's package.json contains some additional metadata under the following keys: <br /><br />
"copyright or licensing"<br /><br />
